#what we have to play around with in this database:
# web_url
# phone
# zip
# gis_id (sounds like a foreign key for mapping with some other table)
# address
# numrooms
# name
# latitude/longitude
# addrid (another foreign key)


#okay'd generating random data to supplement this table with duke so we can create a more complex program


# boolean = [true, false]
# pool = pool.sample


#hotel cost = rand(900)

# breakfast = boolean.sample

# breakfast = boolean.sample
  #if true
  #breakfast_good? = boolean.sample
  #else breakfast_good = false

# gym = boolean.sample 

# def bedbugs 
  #has_bugs = boolean.sample
      #if true value = rand(100000000000000)
      #if false value = 0 
      #puts this hotel has an average of #{value} bedbugs in each room.


#rating = a float between 1 and 5. Obvs this is going to utilize .rand but I'm really bad at that.


#do we need reviews?
